\section{Part C: Performance Report/Reflection}
\subsection{}
In the realm of live music, where notes hang in the air like suspended dreams, I embarked on two transcendent journeys—one with the legendary Pink Floyd and the other guided by the cinematic genius of Hans Zimmer. These candlelight concerts, each distinct in genre and style, unfolded like ancient scrolls, revealing the magic of sound and light. As the gentle glow of candle flames danced around me, I bore witness to musical alchemy that defied time and space.

Pink Floyd, the architects of cosmic rock, emerged from the shadows at The Great Hall in Toronto, Canada, on \textbf{January 24th, 2024}. Their performance was a progressive odyssey that captivated the audience with intricate compositions, experimental sounds, and thought-provoking lyrics. Roger Waters' introspective vocals echoed through the venue, accompanied by layers of instrumental texture that wove intricate patterns—the bassist anchoring, the keyboardist painting celestial hues, and the lead guitarist conjuring haunting notes. The dynamics shifted seamlessly from hushed whispers to thunderous crescendos, mirroring life's ebb and flow. The concert provided valuable insights into the genre of progressive rock, as discussed in "On Bowie/Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and its Legacy" by Edward Komara\autocite{reynolds}.

A month later, on \textbf{February 26th, 2024}, the Maxwell Meighen Centre in Toronto hosted the Hans Zimmer Candlelight Concert. Zimmer's orchestral compositions unfolded, evoking powerful emotions and cinematic imagery. The absence of lyrics did not diminish the impact, as the instrumental texture transported the audience through cinematic landscapes. Zimmer's ability to manipulate dynamics, from swelling crescendos to gentle recedings, mirrored the tides of our hearts. The concert provided valuable insights into film music and orchestral compositions, as discussed in "Opera on Screen" by Marcia J. Citron\autocite{citron2000opera}.

Both concerts transcended mere entertainment to evoke a sense of wonder and introspection. The Pink Floyd concert immersed the audience in the raw emotion and musical prowess of progressive rock, while the Hans Zimmer concert transported them to the realms of cinematic storytelling and emotional resonance. These experiences enriched the understanding of music's capacity to transcend boundaries and connect us to the depths of human experience. As the final chords of Zimmer's "Time" from \textit{Inception} resonated, the audience was left in awe, as if Zimmer had orchestrated their souls, conducting a symphony of memories and dreams.

In conclusion, the Pink Floyd and Hans Zimmer candlelight concerts offered profound journeys into the realms of progressive rock and cinematic orchestration, respectively. Each performance, enveloped in the soft glow of candlelight, left indelible impressions, weaving threads of wonder into the souls of the audience.
